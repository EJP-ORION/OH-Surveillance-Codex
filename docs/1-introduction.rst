Introduction / Background
=========================

Zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continue to be significant
impediments to human and animal health and to socioeconomic development
worldwide [1]_, [2]_, [3]_. National and international surveillance
systems and monitoring programmes for zoonoses, zoonotic agents and AMR
are means to combat these impediments. It is generally recognized that
human and animal health are interconnected and that the transmission of
zoonoses and AMR can essentially take place through various links of the
human-animal interface e.g. the environment or food  [4]_, [5]_. This
implies that surveillance and monitoring cannot be addressed by the
human or animal sector alone, but instead have to be a multisectoral and
multidisciplinary collaboration  [6]_. This approach to collaboration is
referred to as One Health. The benefits and importance of One Health
Surveillance (OHS) are widely accepted, however, there are still gaps in
surveillance or surveillance data that hinder a truly integrated OHS
approach.

Within the EU, EFSA and ECDC have made substantial efforts to harmonize
data collection and reporting within their sectors. These achievements
are important assets for future OHS harmonization efforts, for example
the Data Collection Framework
(`DCF <https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/en-444>`__\  [7]_)
and the SIGMA project
(`SIGMA <https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/en-1428>`__\  [8]_)
from EFSA, as well as the European Surveillance System
(`TESSy <https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/european-surveillance-system-tessy>`__\  [9]_)
from ECDC. Other ongoing joint efforts of theses stakeholders support
OHS data harmonization as well, for example the joint molecular typing
database (URL: ). Another collaborative effort is the compilation of the
yearly European Summary Reports (EUSRs) on trends and sources of
zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks and on antimicrobial
resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and
food (URL: https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/publications). However, the
current practice of provisioning OHS data in reports could be improved,
specifically when it comes to national or research data not covered by
European legislation. Moreover, no generic strategy for surveillance
data reporting is currently available that could be adopted by all, OHS
related scientific disciplines including e.g. environmental science.

The Joint Integrative Project (JIP) “One health suRveillance Initiative
on harmOnization of data collection and interpretatioN” (ORION) aims at
establishing and strengthening inter-institutional collaboration and
transdisciplinary knowledge transfer in the area of One Health
Surveillance (OHS) data integration and interpretation. Detailed
requirement analyses were performed within ORION to identify current
best practices, resources and needs within the OHS community
(References: ). Results from the requirement analyses confirmed that
cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary communication, collaboration and
knowledge exchange are still significant challenges for the OHS
community. In addition, the results reinforced the need for better
harmonization of reports on OHS data, which could ultimately lead to
improved mutual understanding and use of sector-specific data in future
OH analysis.

This OHS Codex therefore aims at establishing a high-level framework
that supports collaboration, mutual understanding, knowledge exchange
and data interoperability between OH sectors, that will support
integrated OHS data analyses and reporting.

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this OHS Codex is to provide users with guidance and
resources, e.g. tools, technical solutions, guidance documents, that
improve collaboration, mutual understanding and knowledge exchange
between the different OHS sectors. Moreover, it is ought to support
better surveillance data integration and interpretation, along the One
Health (OH) objective of improving health and well-being. The OHS Codex
thereby supports the ambitions outlined in chapter 3, 4, and 5.1 to 5.3
of the FAO, OIE and WHO document ‘Taking a Multisectoral, One Health
Approach: A Tripartite Guide to Addressing Zoonotic Diseases in
Countries” [10]_ (Tripartite Guide) by proposing specific resources that
support putting a true One Health approach (as described in the
Tripartite Guide) into practice.

Target community, main stakeholders and organizations
-----------------------------------------------------

According to the understanding of the authors elements of the OHS Codex
will be useful for

organizations or researchers that are

-  involved in One Health surveillance implementation

-  involved in One Health surveillance data reporting

-  involved in One Health data harmonization and standardization

Specifically, this includes

-  Organisations that are members of the EJP consortium

-  other national authorities involved in OHS

-  European authorities and institutes, as e.g. EFSA, ECDC, EEA

-  other stakeholders in OHS, as e.g. research organizations

Scope
-----

The OHS Codex aims at being generically applicable for surveillance
purposes in all OH sectors, including those that were not directly
involved in the development of the OHS Codex e.g. the environmental
sector. The OHS Codex aims also at being applicable to all countries,
geographic areas and administrative levels. However, we recognize that
the resources were created based on surveillance within the animal
health, food safety and public health sector. Therefore they may not
consider every situation of OHS given the wide scope of countries and
OHS contexts. It is also beyond the scope of the OHS Codex to create
mechanisms or provide new structures for surveillance data sharing.

Users of this guide are invited to take the provided methods as
practical examples that can be adapted to their contexts, needs, and
requirements.

Principles
----------

The OHS Codex framework defines that improved cross-sector understanding
and information exchange requires actions in four dedicated “areas”. In
this OHS Codex these “areas” are termed “principles”. It is the ambition
of this OHS Codex to describe these principles and to provide specific
solutions & methods that can be used by the organisations & researchers
to adopt each principle. Several of such methods will be developed and
tested within the EJP ORION project, so that these are included right
from the beginning into the OHS Codex document. As the OHS Codex is
designed itself as an updatable online resource and it will be
continuously extended as soon as new useful methods & solutions become
available.
