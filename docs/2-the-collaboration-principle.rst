The Collaboration principle: Supporting OHS collaboration & cross-sectorial communication
=========================================================================================


Purpose
-------

The collaboration principle defines that collaboration and mutual
understanding are the foundations for all cross-sector One Health
activities. The tools and practices collected under this principle
enable inter-sector communication and help to overcome barriers to
collaboration e.g. resistance to changes to intra-sector traditions. For
example, a cross-sector OHS glossary supports communication by
supporting efforts to find a shared language and unambiguous terminology
across sectors to avoid misunderstandings. The OHS idea catalogue
describing successful cross-sector surveillance initiatives in different
countries will support the belief in self-efficacy by demonstrating that
when there is a will, there is way. The experience-sharing will
encourage discussions and may lead to new solutions for collaborative
approaches supporting OHS.

Scope
-----

The resources provided within this principle are meant to be generically
applicable for surveillance purposes in all OH sectors, including those
sectors that were not directly involved in the development process e.g.
the environmental sector. In addition they are meant to be applicable to
all European countries, geographic areas and administrative levels.

Methods

OHEJP Glossary
''''''''''''''
   
   The OHEJP Glossary is a freely available online resource that
   comprises an extensive list of OHS-related terms and definitions. The
   interface of the glossary allows users to search and filter for
   entries in the glossary. It further provides a reference to the
   source of each definition and an Unique Resource Identifier (URI) for
   specific referencing of each glossary entry. The purpose of the OHEJP
   Glossary is primarily to highlight differences and similarities in
   the interpretation of terms used by different OH sectors, disciplines
   and stakeholders. It does not aim to create harmonized definitions of
   OHS-related terms. The OHEJP Glossary is developed and maintained as
   a collaborative effort of three EJP projects, namely ORION, NOVA and
   COHESIVE, with support from OH experts of EJP stakeholders.

OHS Initiatives - ideas and inspiration (OHS Inspiration catalogue)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Changes and new initiatives are often hampered by the lack of vision
   to imagine that new ways can work or the inability to conceptualise a
   new approach. The OHS Initiative Catalogue is a resource that
   provides ideas and inspiration by describing OHS success stories. It
   shows different ways of overcoming barriers such as data-sharing,
   communication and strategic changes in OHS in many steps of the
   surveillance pathway. The Inspiration catalogue provides 15 examples
   of successfully implemented and functioning One Health Surveillance
   initiatives from all over the EU and aims to inspire new approaches
   in OHS in other MS.

Examples & Lessons learned
--------------------------

   Several ORION project partners carry out national pilot studies to
   test the Collaboration principles within a cross sectional approach.
   Findings from these pilot studies will be reported here.
