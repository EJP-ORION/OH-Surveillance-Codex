The Collaboration principle: Supporting OHS collaboration & cross-sectorial communication
=========================================================================================


Purpose
-------

The collaboration principle defines that collaboration and mutual
understanding are the foundations for all cross-sector One Health
activities. The tools and practices collected under this principle
enable inter-sector communication and help to overcome barriers to
collaboration, such as changes of intra-sector traditions. A
cross-sector OHS glossary supports communication by suggesting a common
language and terminology in surveillance across sectors to avoid
misunderstandings and maintain a professional language. A catalogue
describing successful cross-sector surveillance initiatives in different
countries will support the belief in self-efficacy by demonstrating that
when there is a will, there is way. The experience-sharing will
encourage discussions and may lead to mutual new solutions to
collaborative approaches within OHS.

Scope
-----

The resources provided within this principle are aimed at being
generically applicable for surveillance purposes in all OH sectors,
including those that were not directly involved in the development
process e.g. the environmental sector. In addition they are ment to be
applicable to all countries, geographic areas and administrative levels.

OHEJP Glossary
''''''''''''''

   The OHEJP Glossary is a freely available online resource that
   comprises an extensive list of OH-related terms and definitions. The
   interface of the glossary allows users to search and filter for
   entries in the glossary. It further provides a reference to the
   source of each definition and an Unique Resource Identifier (URI) for
   specific referencing of each glossary entry. The purpose of the OHEJP
   Glossary is primarily to highlight differences and similarities in
   the interpretation of terms used by different OH sectors, disciplines
   and stakeholders. It does not aim to create harmonized definitions of
   OHS-related terms. The OHEJP Glossary is developed and maintained as
   a collaborative effort of three EJP projects, namely ORION, NOVA and
   COHESIVE, with support from OH experts of EJP stakeholders.

OHS Initiatives - ideas and inspiration (OHS Inspiration catalogue)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The OHS Initiative - ideas and inspiration resource address the
   issue, that tradition is difficult to change and necessary changes
   are often hampered by the lack of ability to view things differently
   or conceptualising a new approach. The Inspiration catalogue provides
   examples of already implemented and functioning One Health
   Surveillance initiatives from all over the EU to inspire new
   approaches in other MS.

Examples & Lessons learned
--------------------------

   Several ORION project partners carry out national pilot studies to
   test the Collaboration principles within a cross sectional approach.
   Findings from these pilot studies will be reported here.
