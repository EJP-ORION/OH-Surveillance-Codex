5. The Dissemination principle: Supporting external communication of One Health Surveillance outcomes
=====================================================================================================


Purpose
-------

The dissemination principle defines that better surveillance data
integration and interpretation needs improved cross-sector One Health Surveillance
report integration and harmonization. The resources provided within this
principle are meant to support the cross-sector harmonized
provisioning of metadata in OHS reports and e.g. to provide a foundation
for advice to risk managers. Best practice examples illustrate how the
reporting of surveillance outputs using new checklists and templates
relying on cross-sectoral analysis of surveillance outputs, will improve
the value for all stakeholders. It also demonstrates that such
activities support the cross-sector understanding of contextual
information in future OH surveillance reports.


Scope
-----

The resources provided within this principle are directed towards the
activities linked to report generation or dissemination of surveillance
data and results. Proposed solutions were designed to be generically
applicable for any surveillance activity in all OH sectors, including
those that were not directly involved in their development e.g. the
environmental sector. In addition they should be applicable to all
European countries, geographic areas and administrative levels.


Methods
-------

One Health Consensus Report Annotation Checklist (OH-CRAC)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   To achieve OHS report harmonization we are proposing the
   establishment and adoption of a so-called **“One Health Consensus Report
   Annotation Checklist” (OH-CRAC)**. The adoption of OH-CRAC will allow all
   existing OHS metadata to be mapped to one concurrent metadata schema,
   instead of cross-mapping metadata between several sectoral and
   institutional metadata systems as illustrated in Figure 5. The
   implementation and comprehension of the OH-CRAC will thereby cause
   minimal efforts for all involved parties. OH-CRAC is also available
   as an interactive online tool that allows the provisioning of
   surveillance meta-information in an easy and user-friendly manner

National OHS Report Templates
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   Surveillance of zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often carried out in multiple
   animal species, foods and/or people and reported separately.
   Sometimes, outputs from different sectors are reported in the same
   report or in the same chapters, but usually every author/sector
   provides their own text and graphics. This tends to present the
   providers’ perspective rather than focussing on the receiver needs
   and may not interpret the data from a One Health perspective. To
   support One Health reporting, examples or templates to report
   different types of hazards with a One Health focus have been developed. The
   templates demonstrate how to report e.g. AMR in foodborne zoonoses
   throughout the food chain and focusing on the consequences for humans
   and animals or how to report zoonotic trends, whilst enhancing the
   One Health focus.

Outbreaks of infectious diseases in Norway in 2020. Annual report (Utbrudd av smittsomme sykdommer i Norge i 2020. Årsrapport)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This report provides an overview of outbreaks that have been notified to
the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in 2020. It is important to
point out that this overview does not provide a full and complete
picture of outbreaks in Norway during this period. The degree of
underreporting varies considerably. This report is based on information
from the outbreak alert system, Vesus
(`www.vesuv.no <http://www.vesuv.no>`__)which contains information on
outbreaks of infectious disease in the population and the cause of the
outbreaks.

Norwegian Annual report 2020 - Surveillance of infections from food, water and animals including vector borne diseases
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This annual report describes the incidence of the most common diseases
that are transmitted by food, water and animals, including vector-borne
infections, which have been reported to the Norwegian Institute of
Public Health in 2020. The report includes interactive links to websites
with further background information on the various diseases mentioned in
the report.

Surveillance of infectious diseases in animals and humans in Sweden 2020
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Surveillance of infectious diseases in animals and humans is the annual
report describing the surveillance activities carried out in Sweden
during the year. The report covers surveillance for important animal
diseases and zoonotic agents in humans, food, feed and animals, carried
out and compiled by experts from several Swedish governmental agencies,
university and the private industry with surveillance mandates along the
entire food chain, from farm to fork.

Examples & Lessons learned
--------------------------

   The pilot studies carried out in the ORION project confirmed that the
   impact of surveillance activities largely depends on the
   effectiveness of the dissemination process. In the execution of the
   pilot studies in the ORION project it was highlighted the importance
   of involving relevant actors participating in the surveillance
   activity during the writing of the dissemination outputs. This means
   not only participants from within each organisation but also from all
   other agencies, collaborators and stakeholders involved to ensure
   that the output is correctly contextualised. Another practical aspect
   that complicates surveillance result dissemination is the fact that
   despite agreements for data sharing across different
   bodies/institutions might exist the different internal policies can
   make the dissemination of data complicated and slow.

   The Belgian and Danish pilots conducted during the One Health EJP H2020 
   ORION project considered as important the dissemination of results, not only at
   national level but also to other countries (pilot reports provided as
   annexes under the deliverables JIP1-2.7 and JIP1-2.9,
   respectively) [21]_, [22]_. In general, it was highlighted that the
   dissemination of surveillance outputs should be more frequent
   transparent and concise in the future. In the German [23]_,
   Swedish [24]_ and Danish [22]_ pilots it could be shown, that in order to
   create OH oriented surveillance reports it might be useful to change
   the structure of current surveillance reports, e.g. by introducing
   new sections, re-structuring them into OH chapters to harmonise the
   provisioning of the outputs or by using checklists like OH-CRAC. From
   the experience within the ORION pilots one can conclude that the
   efforts needed to implement such improvements are well invested, as
   the newly designed surveillance reports were very well accepted by
   policy users. Also the application of the new OH-CRAC checklist was
   tested extensively and received positive feedback.
