Guidelines for OHS Codex/KIP contributors
=====================================

The OHS Codex/KIP is a living resource that continuously evolves adapting to
the needs of the OH practitioners. Therefore, we welcome and encourage
the OH community to contribute to the OHS Codex/KIP.

**How to contribute to the OHS Codex/KIP**

**Types of contributions**
------------------------

**Methods**

   The new methods should be introduced by a short description that
   allows the OHS Codex/KIP users to decide whether this particular method can
   be relevant to their specific situation. Please remember that the OHS
   Codex/KIP is not designed as an exhaustive guide but as a list of
   existing resources related to each of the defined principles. Further
   information about the method can be provided by a link or reference
   where a more detailed description about the method can be accessed.

   Enter the new method under the principle this new method applies and
   specify how it helps to overcome the barriers addressed under this
   specific principle with an OH perspective.

**Lessons learned**

   Here you can share the experience of applying/implementing any of the 
   methods listed in the OHS Codex/KIP. Under this section you can link to reports that describe
   success stories as well as limitations and challenges.
   
**General improvement**

   Here we consider:

-  typo corrections

-  fixing broken references or links

-  inaccurate or out-of-date information (new features, links or
   references

-  addition of better explanations through clearer writing and/or
   additional examples of lessons learned.

**Principles**

   Currently, the OHS Codex/KIP is structured according to four core
   principles that were jointly defined by OHEJP ORION and MATRIX project members as
   critical to enhance OHS data analyses and interpretation. If you
   consider that the scope and objective of the OHS Codex/KIP can be
   extended to other areas of action and this way support a wider OH
   community, propose a new principle section under the OHS Codex/KIP
   document providing a description of the purpose and scope of this
   principle. If possible include existing solutions or methods
   available to support OHS researchers, organisations or stakeholders.
   Proposal to extend the scope of the OHS Codex/KIP will only be considered 
   if the author provides contact information, so the OHS Codex/KIP team can 
   invite that author to the OHS Codex/KIP steering board discussions. 


**Evaluation of the contributions**
---------------------------------

The new contributions will be evaluated by the OHS Codex/KIP steering board,
which meets on a regular basis to ensure the continuous update and
maintenance of the OHS Codex/KIP. The steering board will evaluate your
add/change request and contact you in case more information is
necessary.

For further questions please contact us via ejp-orion@bfr.bund.de.
