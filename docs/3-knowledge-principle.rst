3. The Knowledge principle: Improving the One Health Surveillance knowledge base
=================================================================================



Purpose
-------

The Knowledge principle defines that better surveillance planning, data
integration and interpretation needs efficient and continuous knowledge
exchange and joined knowledge evolution between all One Health parties.

Therefore, the purpose of this principle is to provide surveillance
professionals and stakeholders with guidance on available knowledge
resources that may be used to foster an One Health approach within their area of
work, or to increase the value of their sector-specific surveillance
reports for future One Health analysis.


Scope
-----

The Knowledge principle focus on providing a resource to exchange
knowledge on

-  existing surveillance data collections

-  established methods for surveillance data analysis and interpretation

-  current methods for surveillance planning

-  experiences with implementation of new technologies supporting surveillance


Although many surveillance systems and data are already shared with EFSA
and ECDC, there are several additional national surveillance systems
that are not. The results from these surveillance systems can be
difficult to access as reports are often only published in the national
language and not listed in scientific databases (e.g. PubMed).

Overall, the solutions & tools provided under the Knowledge principle
aim to collate and improve access to surveillance data, improve
knowledge of methods to interpret and analyse surveillance data and
elucidate new technologies supporting surveillance. Furthermore, each is
designed to be maintainable in a collaborative manner. Together, these
solutions and tools are expected to support cross-sector, as well as
within sector surveillance activities in the future.


Methods
-------

OH Knowledge Base – Surveillance systems
'''''''''''''''''''''''

   The OH Knowledge Base – Surveillance systems consist of:

   (1) an inventory of existing surveillance systems carried out in
   different countries including links to the literature or websites.
   The objective was to generate a comprehensive list of surveillance
   systems in the One Health approach. It was accomplished by
   collaboration between One Health EJP H2020 ORION project and EFSA/ECDC using 
   similar terminology in describing the surveillance systems. The interface of
   the inventories provides users with easy and intuitive search
   functions. The first version is published at
   https://shiny.fli.de/ife-apps/EJPOrion_WP2Epi/.

   2) a database that provides an overview of the common statistical
   methods used for surveillance data within the EU. Furthermore, it
   also contains a selection of links to literature, sample calculations
   in R and software solutions on the internet recommended for
   surveillance data. This enables a comparison between the existing
   methods and the methods actually used in surveillance projects and
   inspires institutes to consider new data analytical methodologies.
   The first version is published at
   https://shiny.fli.de/ife-apps/toolsdatabase/.

   (3) a literature database gathering reports, scientific literature,
   and web resources. The collection of the literature is carried out
   using a literature database (Zotero,
   https://www.zotero.org/groups/2204615/ejp_orion_wp2epi_data_sources_surveillance_systems/library).
   As Zotero requires registration, contributors need to be invited.
   Nevertheless, to be able to access the resources without
   registration, the database will be accessible via the web
   applications too.


OH Knowledge Base - The Sequencing for Surveillance Handbook
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The Sequencing for Surveillance (SfS) Handbook is a web-based
   resource containing best practice advice and hands on experience for
   how to set up and use sequencing for surveillance in a OH-supporting
   manner . The handbook currently consists of the following sections:
   
   -  public guidance documents from institutions such as EFSA and ECDC

   -  descriptions of infrastructural solutions for sequencing and analysis

   -  review of bioinformatics tools and pipelines used for analyzing and typing foodborne pathogens

   -  databases and other resources needed to perform analyses for species specific analyses

   -  guidance on how to use typing data for surveillance and outbreak detection, including clustering guidelines

..

   As part of the infrastructure and pipeline sections, the handbook
   will include guidelines on how institutions can best process their
   data and how data can be shared between institutions. In addition, we
   are creating a prototype analysis system for Listeria, which will
   serve as a test case for guidelines on how to analyze NGS data in a
   reproducible and reliable way.

RAKIP Model Repository
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The 'Risk Assessment Modelling and Knowledge Integration Platform'
   (RAKIP) partners BfR, ANSES and DTU Food developed the RAKIP Model
   Repository with the aim of supporting modellers, scientists, risk
   assessors and risk managers in their efforts to share and re-use
   mathematical models as well as data analysis procedures across One Health
   sectors. The RAKIP Model Repository is a curated web-based database
   currently populated with executable mathematical models relevant for
   food safety. These models are provided in the `Food Safety Knowledge
   eXchange (FSKX) format <https://oh-surveillance-codex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4-the-data-principle.html#fskx-format-guidance-document>`__, 
   an open exchange format that can include data,
   model scripts, visualization scripts, simulation settings and harmonized
   metadata on the model / data. The RAKIP model repository provides a
   user-friendly interface to access, filter and download the FSKX model
   file. Registered users can also execute, edit or join models online.

Manual for One Health Surveillance Dashboards
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

  This is an online dashboard inventory and practical manual to facilitate the design and implementation of
  One Health Surveillance dashboards using open source tools. More information is available at the
  Dashboard Information Centre here.
  The Dashboard Information Centre is a “living document” that contains an inventory of planned, ongoing and
  finished dashboard projects, a practical manual and a best practice guide to the development of One Health
  Surveillance dashboards. It covers the following topics: i) information context and end-user considerations; ii)
  technical and legal barriers associated with cross sector data sharing; iii) the pitfalls and biases of coanalysing
  One Health data; iv) the selection of the most suitable technical implementation. It is meant to be
  used as a “companion” when planning or developing a dashboard.
  
  Status of implementation: the Dashboard Information Centre is available `here. <https://sva-se.github.io/MATRIX-dashboards/>`_ 


Examples & Lessons learned
--------------------------

   Several One Health EJP H2020 ORION project partners carry out national 
   pilot studies to test methods from the Knowledge principle regarding 
   usability within a cross sectional approach. Findings from these pilot 
   studies will be reported here.
