=========================================================
The Knowledge principle: Improving the OHS knowledge base
=========================================================



Purpose
-------

The Knowledge principle defines that better surveillance data
integration and interpretation needs efficient and continuous knowledge
exchange and joined knowledge evolution between all OH parties.

The purpose of this principle is therefore to provide surveillance
professionals and stakeholders with guidance on available knowledge
resources they may be used to foster a One Health approach within their
area of work or to increase the value of their sector-specific
surveillance reports for future One Health analysis. The solutions and
methods developed within the ORION project supporting the adoption of
this principle can also be accessed via the *One Health Surveillance
Knowledge Hub,* a web-based technical infrastructure that facilitates
knowledge exchange and joint knowledge generation within and across
domains. Examples of such knowledge resources are the inventory of
existing European surveillance systems for zoonoses, an inventory of
statistical methods and tools used within those surveillance systems as
well as an online handbook with guidance on implementation of national
NGS infrastructure for improved One Health surveillance.


Scope
-----

The Knowledge principle focus on providing a resource to exchange
knowledge on

-  existing surveillance data collections

-  established methods for surveillance data analysis and interpretation

-  current methods for surveillance planning

-  experiences with implementation of new technologies supporting surveillance


Despite the fact that already many surveillance systems and data are
shared with EFSA and ECDC, there are several additional national
surveillance systems in place where often surveillance reports are only
published in national language. Furthermore, these results are often
only published as reports and not listed in scientific databases (e.g.
PubMed). The solutions & tools provided under the Knowledge principle
will therefore support cross-sector as well as within sector
surveillance activities in the future. Each of them are also designed to
be maintainable in a collaborative manner.



Methods
-------

OH Knowledge Base – Inventory of Surveillance systems and methods
'''''''''''''''''''''''

The OH Knowledge Base – Surveillance systems consist of:

   (1) an inventory of existing surveillance systems carried out in
   different countries including links to the literature or websites.
   The objective was to generate a comprehensive list of surveillance
   systems in the One Health approach. It was accomplished by
   collaboration between EJP ORION and EFSA/ECDC using similar
   terminology in listing the surveillance systems. The interface of the
   inventories allows users to search in the inventories. A first
   version is published at
   https://joerngethmann.shinyapps.io/EJPOrion_AHS.

   2) a database provides an overview of the common statistical methods
   used for surveillance data within the EU. Furthermore, it also
   contains a selection of links to literature, sample calculations in R
   and software solutions on the internet recommended for surveillance
   data. This enables a comparison between the existing methods and the
   methods actually used in surveillance projects and inspires
   institutes to consider new data analytical methodologies. A first
   version is published at
   https://statmethods.shinyapps.io/toolsdatabase/.

   (3) a literature database gathering reports, scientific literature,
   and web resources. The collection of the literature is carried out by
   using a literature database (Zotero,
   https://www.zotero.org/groups/2204615/ejp_orion_wp2epi_data_sources_surveillance_systems/library).
   As Zotero requires registration, contributors need to be invited.
   Nevertheless, to be able to access the resources without
   registration, the database will be accessible via the web
   applications, too.


OH Knowledge Base - The Sequencing for Surveillance Handbook
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The Sequencing for Surveillance (SfS) Handbook is a web-based
   resource that will contain best practice advice and hands on
   experience of how to set up and use sequencing for surveillance in a
   OH-supporting manner . The handbook currently consists of the
   following sections:

-  public guidance documents from institutions such as EFSA and ECDC

-  descriptions of infrastructure solutions for sequencing and analysis

-  review of bioinformatics tools and pipelines used for analyzing and typing foodborne pathogens

-  databases and other resources needed to perform analyses for species specific analyses

-  guidance on how to use typing data for surveillance and outbreak detection, including clustering guidelines

..

   This handbook will as part of the infrastructure and pipeline
   sections include guidelines on how institutions can best process
   their data and how data can be shared between institutions. In
   addition, we are creating a prototype analysis system for Listeria,
   which will serve as a test case for guidelines on how to analyze NGS
   data in a reproducible and reliable way.

Examples & Lessons learned
--------------------------

   Several ORION project partners carry out national pilot studies to
   test methods from the Knowledge principle regarding usability within
   a cross sectional approach. Findings from these pilot studies will be
   reported here.
