The Knowledge principle: Improving the OHS knowledge base
=========================================================



Purpose
-------

The Knowledge principle defines that better surveillance data
integration and interpretation needs efficient and continuous knowledge
exchange and joined knowledge evolution between all OH parties.

The purpose of this principle is therefore to provide surveillance
professionals and stakeholders with guidance on available knowledge
resources they may use to foster a One Health approach within their area
of work or to increase the value of their sector-specific surveillance
reports for future One Health analysis. The solutions and methods
developed within the ORION project supporting the adoption of this
principle can be accessed via the *One Health Surveillance Knowledge
Hub,* a web-based technical infrastructure that facilitates knowledge
exchange and joint knowledge generation within and across domains.
Examples of such knowledge resources are the inventory of existing
European surveillance systems, an inventory of statistical methods and
tools used within those surveillance systems as well as an online
handbook with guidance on implementation of national NGS infrastructure
for improved One Health surveillance.


Scope
-----

The Knowledge principle focus on providing a resource to exchange
knowledge on

-  existing surveillance data collections

-  existing methods for surveillance data analysis and interpretation

-  existing methods for surveillance planning

-  Experiences with implementation of new technologies supporting
      surveillance

Despite the fact that already many surveillance systems and data is
shared with EFSA and ECDC, there are several additional national
surveillance systems in place where often surveillance reports are only
published in national language. Furthermore, these results are often
only published as reports and not listed in scientific databases (e.g.
PubMed). The solutions & tools provided under the Knowledge principle
will therefore support cross-sector as well as within sector
surveillance activities in the future. Each of them are also designed to
be maintainable in a collaborative manner.


Methods
-------

OH Knowledge Base - Epi
'''''''''''''''''''''''

   The OH Knowledge Base - Epi consist of:

   (1) an inventory of surveillance systems carried out in different
   countries including links to the literature or websites. The
   development strategy was to get a comprehensive list of surveillance
   systems in the OneHealth approach. The development approach was a
   collaboration between EJP ORION and EFSA/ECDC to use similar
   terminology in listing the surveillance systems. The interface of the
   inventories allows users to search in the databases.

   (2) an inventory of methods and tools used in the analysis of
   surveillance data and that are listed in the surveillance systems,
   tools & methods. In this inventory, statistical tools and methods of
   specific importance in surveillance projects were collected.
   Furthermore, the database contains a collection of links to
   literature, sample calculations in R and software solutions on the
   internet. The database provides an overview of the common statistical
   methods and enables a comparison between the existing methods and the
   methods actually used in surveillance projects.

   (3) an inventory of data sources (reports, scientific literature, web
   resources, etc.). For this inventory we use a literature database to
   collect relevant resources. This inventory will be the basis for the
   resources and will therefore be linked to the inventories (1) and (2)

OH Knowledge Base - NGS
'''''''''''''''''''''''

   The OH Knowledge Base - NGS is a web-based handbook that will contain
   best practice advice and hands on experience of how to set up and use
   sequencing for surveillance. The handbook currently consists of the
   following sections:

-  public guidance documents from institutions such as EFSA and ECDC

-  infrastructure solutions for sequencing and analysis

-  review of bioinformatics tools and pipelines used for analyzing and
      typing foodborne pathogens

-  databases and other resources needed to perform analyses for species
      specific analyses

-  guidance on how to use typing data for surveillance and outbreak
      detection, including clustering guidelines

..

   This handbook will as part of the infrastructure and pipeline
   sections include guidelines on how institutions can best process
   their data and how data can be shared between institutions. In
   addition, we are creating a prototype analysis pipeline for Listeria,
   which will serve as a test case for guidelines on how to analyze NGS
   data in a reproducible and reliable way.

Examples & Lessons learned
--------------------------

   Several ORION project partners carry out national pilot studies to
   test methods from the Knowledge principle regarding usability within
   a cross sectional approach. Findings from these pilot studies will be
   reported here.
