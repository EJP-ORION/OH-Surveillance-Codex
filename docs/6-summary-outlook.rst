Summary and Outlook
===================

The OHS Codex is a new framework that helps to establish and strengthen
inter-institutional collaboration and transdisciplinary knowledge
transfer in the area of surveillance data integration and
interpretation, along the One Health (OH) objective of improving health
and well-being.

It is based on the observation that improved surveillance data
integration and interpretation can only be achieved if responsible
institutions perform practical steps in at least one of the two action
areas:

1. Improve existing sector specific surveillance data reporting such
      that data and reports can be better used in the context of OH in
      the future

2. Plan, execute or improve joint surveillance efforts that consider the
      OH needs right from the beginning.

To support such practical steps the OHS Codex has been designed in such
a way, that it can act as a resource itself, i.e. it provides a
collection of methods, tools and resources that could be used or
customized by interested institutions. Compared to the guidance
available in the Tripartite Guide the OHS Codex focus on the needs of
national European institutions. It has also been designed as a living
document, so that it can be updated continuously. The OHS Codex
framework specifically takes into account that implementation of
improvements into established surveillance routines is an extraordinary
challenge. For that reason the OHS Codex acts as an “umbrella” for
solutions supporting better surveillance data integration and
interpretation in the future (and it is generic enough to include
solutions from other EJP Integrative Action projects as well).
