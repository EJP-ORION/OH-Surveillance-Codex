===================
Summary and Outlook
===================

The OHS Codex/KIP is a new framework that helps to establish and strengthen
inter-institutional collaboration and transdisciplinary knowledge
transfer in the area of surveillance data integration and
interpretation, along the One Health (OH) objective of improving health
and well-being.

It is based on the observation that improved surveillance data
integration and interpretation can only be achieved if responsible
institutions perform practical steps in at least one of the two action
areas:

1. Improve existing sector specific surveillance data reporting such that data and reports can be better used in the context of OH in the future

2. Plan, execute or improve joint surveillance efforts that consider the OH needs right from the beginning.

To support such practical steps the OHS Codex/KIP has been designed in such
a way, that it can act as a resource itself, i.e. it provides a
collection of methods, tools and resources that could be used or
customized by interested institutions. Compared to the guidance
available in the Tripartite Guide the OHS Codex/KIP focus on the needs of
national European institutions. It has also been designed as a living
document, so that it can be updated continuously. The OHS Codex/KIP
framework specifically takes into account that implementation of
improvements into established surveillance routines is an extraordinary
challenge. For that reason the OHS Codex/KIP acts as an “umbrella” for
solutions supporting better surveillance data integration and
interpretation in the future. The OHS Codex/KIP aims at raising
awareness of the work achieved by other One Health EJP H2020 projects 
highlighting the outcomes from other scientific and integrative activities 
that can be of help by the OH community such as the inventory described below.

**One Health EJP Outcome Inventory**

The `One Health EJP Outcome
Inventory <https://onehealthejp.eu/outcome-inventory/>`__ is a public
online database that catalogues the outcomes and updates of the Joint
Research and Joint Integrative Projects of the One Health EJP. It
actively links stakeholders’ needs and interests with the scientific and
integrative results from the consortium. Given its public nature, it is
targeted towards a wide range of stakeholders, including national
stakeholders like ministries of authorities, other One Health networks,
and EU and international agencies"
