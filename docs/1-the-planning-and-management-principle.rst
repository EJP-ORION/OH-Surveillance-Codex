The Planning and Management principle
==========================================================================


Purpose
-------

The Planning and Management principle defines that an OH-oriented 
surveillance organization and management can lead to a more effective
OH data generation and decision making. The resources provided under
this principle are meant to support and strengthen the planning and 
management tasks along the whole `surveillance process <https://oh-surveillance-codex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-the-collaboration-principle.html#oh-surveillance-pathway-visualization>`__. This includes the design, development, establishment, implementation and optimization of surveillance systems with a cross-sector OH approach


Scope
-----
The methods proposed under this principle were designed to support the
activities related to the planning, design and management of
surveillance activities. These methods aim to be applicable to all OH
sectors and adaptable to the OH capacities and capabilities under each
country considering their resource settings.



Methods
-------

FoodChain-Lab tracing software (FCL)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

  The free and open source software FoodChain-Lab (FCL) allows for fast
  and reliable tracing of suspicious food items along complex global
  supply chains during foodborne incidents. It unifies supply chain
  tracing data collection, cleaning, visualisation, analysis and reporting
  in one modular framework. FCL is available as desktop version (FCL
  Desktop) and as web application (FCL Web).

  In both tools, tracing data remains completely on the user side without
  any storage on servers to ensure data protection. FCL is already in use
  by several EU Member States, EFSA and U.S. FDA. In 2020, it became part
  of the SISOT tool box of OIE, WHO and FAO.

  FCL Desktop and FCL Web are joint outputs of several projects (e.g.
  SiLeBAT, EFSA-BfR Framework Partnership Agreements, EJP COHESIVE) and
  will contribute to future projects on traceability together with EFSA
  e.g. by integrating FCL Web into a European framework of tracing tools
  and by developing a universal tracing data exchange format.

  For more information on FCL, please check
  https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/foodchain-lab/. FCL Desktop can be
  installed via https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/installation/. FCL Web is
  available at
  `https://fcl-portal.bfr.berlin <https://fcl-portal.bfr.berlin/>`__. The
  software code is published at https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLab (FCL
  Desktop), https://github.com/SiLeBAT/fcl-client and
  https://github.com/SiLeBAT/fcl-server (both FCL Web).
