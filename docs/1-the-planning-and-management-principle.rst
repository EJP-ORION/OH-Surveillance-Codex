1. The Planning and Management principle: Supporting the whole One Health Surveillance process
==============================================================================================


Purpose
-------

The Planning and Management principle defines that an One Health oriented 
surveillance organization and management can lead to a more effective
One Health coordination, emergency preparedness, data generation and decision making. The resources provided under
this principle are meant to support and strengthen the planning and 
management tasks along the whole `surveillance process <https://oh-surveillance-codex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-the-collaboration-principle.html#oh-surveillance-pathway-visualization>`__. This includes the design, development, establishment, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and optimization of surveillance systems with a cross-sector One Health approach.


Scope
-----
The methods proposed under this principle were designed to support the
activities related to the planning, design, coordination and management of
surveillance activities. These methods aim to be applicable to all One Health
sectors and adaptable to the OH capacities and capabilities under each
country considering their resource settings.



Methods

FoodChain-Lab tracing software (FCL)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

  The free and open source software FoodChain-Lab (FCL) allows for fast
  and reliable tracing of suspicious food items along complex global
  supply chains during foodborne incidents. It unifies supply chain
  tracing data collection, cleaning, visualisation, analysis and reporting
  in one modular framework. FCL is available as desktop version (FCL
  Desktop) and as web application (FCL Web).

  In both tools, tracing data remains completely on the user side without
  any storage on servers to ensure data protection. FCL is already in use
  by several EU Member States, EFSA and U.S. FDA. In 2020, it became part
  of the SISOT tool box of OIE, WHO and FAO.

  FCL Desktop and FCL Web are joint outputs of several projects (e.g.
  SiLeBAT, EFSA-BfR Framework Partnership Agreements, One Health EJP COHESIVE) and
  will contribute to future projects on traceability together with EFSA
  e.g. by integrating FCL Web into a European framework of tracing tools
  and by developing a universal tracing data exchange format.

  For more information on FCL, please check
  https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/foodchain-lab/. FCL Desktop can be
  installed via https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/installation/. FCL Web is
  available at
  `https://fcl-portal.bfr.berlin <https://fcl-portal.bfr.berlin/>`__. The
  software code is published at https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLab (FCL
  Desktop), https://github.com/SiLeBAT/fcl-client and
  https://github.com/SiLeBAT/fcl-server (both FCL Web).

Surveillance Evaluation Framework (SurF)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

  Surveillance Evaluation Framework (SurF) is a free available online
  guideline. It was initially developed by P. Muellner, K.D.C. Stärk, and
  J. Watts [13]_ to provide a fit-for-purpose and efficient surveillance
  evaluation framework for the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) in
  New Zealand to assess surveillance activities, programmes, systems or
  portfolios in a structured and adaptable way.

  SurF builds upon and adapts previous work conducted nationally and
  internationally in the context of the evaluation of human and animal
  health surveillance. This includes in particular the SERVAL Framework
  [14]_, the recently published guidelines by the European
  Centre for Disease Control (ECDC, 2014), as well as the available
  information describing the preliminary version of the EVA tool (RiskSur
  Consortium 2013 & 2015), which at the time of writing is still under
  development. An effort was made to align this framework with the
  national standards proposed by the Aotearoa New Zealand Evaluation
  Association (ANZEA, 2015) where possible.

  SurF provides a common umbrella for surveillance evaluation in the
  animal, plant, environment and marine sectors. It consists of four
  components, each supporting a distinct phase in the evaluation. Each
  component describes the activities and decisions related to a phase
  within an evaluation project: (i) Motivation for the evaluation, (ii)
  Scope of the evaluation, (iii) Evaluation design and implementation, and
  (iv) Reporting and communication of evaluation outputs. The tool
  provides users with an Evaluation Template to guide capturing input.
  Further, SurF provides a visual output that allows for comparison of
  core performance between systems and within individual systems over
  time.
